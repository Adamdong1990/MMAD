Description: The MM algorithm based on AD technology can be used for model estimation of parametric models, semi-parametric models and non-parametric models. We selected parametric models include left truncated normal distribution, type I multivariate zero-inflated generalized Poisson distribution and multivariate compound zero-inflated generalized Poisson distribution; Semiparametric models include Cox model and Gamma Frailty model; nonparametric model is estimate for Type II interval-censored data. These general methods are proposed based on the following papers,
